# news-assessor-google-colab
This project contain all the Jupiter Notebooks that where running on Google Colab to run the experiment for open-source LLMs.

The models (e.g. Llmam-3.2-3b-insturct) should be stored in the models folder.
The project should be open on google colab.
My way was to store the project on Google Drive and mount it to my google colab.
Storage is needed depends on how many models you download from hugging face.
The code to download the models are the scripts.
No pre-installations are needed (google colab manages everything for us).
HF_TOKEN is needed to download the models only.
